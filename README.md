#Drag and Drop for AngularJS (with Animation)

---

###v1.0.5 - breaking change
Do not pass evaluated expressions in callbacks. For example, 
####Before:
```
<div jqyoui-draggable="{onStart:'startCallback({{item}})'}">{{item.title}}</div>
```
####After:
```
<div jqyoui-draggable="{onStart:'startCallback(item)'}">{{item.title}}</div>
```

##Angular Draggable options
* **jqyoui-draggable** – A custom angular attribute to make any element draggable. It holds more settings such as:
    * **index** – number – $index of an item of a model (if it is an array) associated with it
    * **placeholder** – boolean/string – If true, the place will be occupied even though a dragggable is moved/dropped somewhere else. If 'keep' is supplied, the original item won't be removed from the draggable.
    * **animate** – boolean – If true, draggable will be animated towards droppable when dropped. If multiple is not set to true on droppable then its draggable will swap its position.
    * **onStart** – string – callback method to be invoked (has to be defined in a controller) when dragging starts
    * **onStop** – string – callback method to be invoked when dragging stops
    * **onDrag** – string – callback method to be invoked while the mouse is moved during the dragging
    * **sortable** – boolean – If true, the dropped item will be inserted after the droppable and the rest of the items will rotate upwards towards the droppable. This will only work when the draggable and droppable use the same model.
    * **applyFilter** - string - applies AngularJS $filter on the list before swapping items. Only applicable, if ngRepeat has any filter (such as orderBy, limitTo) associated with it.
    * **containment** – string - position/offset. Offset by default. This forces to use jQuery.position() or jQuery.offset() to calculate proper position with respect to parent element or document respectively. 
* **data-drag** – boolean – If true, element can be draggable. Disabled otherwise.
* **data-jqyoui-options** – object – should hold all the valid options supported by [jQueryUI Draggable](http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable)
* **ng-model** – string – An angular model defined in a controller. Should be a JS array or object

##Angular Droppable options
* **jqyoui-droppable** – A custom angular attribute to make any element droppable. It holds more settings such as:
    * **index** – number – $index of an item of a model (if it is an array) associated with it
    * **multiple** – boolean – Requires to be true only if animate is set to true for draggable and to avoid swapping.
    * **stack** – boolean – Requires if animate is set to true on draggable and if multiple draggables positioned one below the other
    * **onDrop** – string – callback method to be invoked a draggable is dropped into the droppable
    * **onOver** – string – callback method to be invoked when an accepted draggable is dragged over the droppable
    * **onOut** – string – callback method to be invoked when an accepted draggable is dragged out of the droppable
    * **applyFilter** - string - requires if both droppable as well as draggable share the same ngModel.
    * **containment** – string - position/offset. Offset by default. This forces to use jQuery.position() or jQuery.offset() to calculate proper position with respect to parent element or document respectively. 
* **data-drop** – boolean – If true, element can be droppable. Disabled otherwise.
* **data-jqyoui-options** – object – should hold all the valid options supported by [jQueryUI Droppable](http://api.jqueryui.com/droppable)
* **ng-model** – string – An angular model defined in a controller. Should be a JS array or object.
